## [1.0.0] - 2024-01-15

### ðŸŽ‰ Initial Release

Complete implementation of the CivicChain backend system with all core features.

### Added

#### Core Backend
- Node.js/Express server with CORS support
- PostgreSQL database with PostGIS extension
- Database migration system
- JWT-based authentication
- Google OAuth integration support
- File upload system with Multer
- Static file serving for uploads

#### API Endpoints
- Authentication endpoints (1)
  - `POST /auth/login` - User login with automatic wallet creation
- User endpoints (2)
  - `GET /user/me` - Get current user profile
  - `GET /user/:user_id` - Get user by ID
- Issue endpoints (8)
  - `POST /issue/classify` - Image upload and AI classification
  - `POST /issue/report` - Submit new issue
  - `GET /issues` - List issues with filters
  - `GET /issue/:id` - Get single issue
  - `POST /issue/:id/upvote` - Upvote issue
  - `POST /issue/:id/downvote` - Downvote issue
  - `POST /issue/:id/verify` - Verify resolved issue
  - `POST /issue/:id/update-status` - Update status (government)
- Admin endpoints (2)
  - `GET /admin/dashboard` - Dashboard statistics
  - `GET /admin/issues` - Advanced issue filtering

#### Database Schema
- `users` table with reputation and badge system
- `issues` table with PostGIS location support
- `votes` table with unique constraints
- `verifications` table with unique constraints
- Custom ENUM types for roles, categories, statuses
- Spatial indexes for proximity queries

#### Business Logic
- Priority scoring algorithm (5-factor calculation)
- Reputation system with dynamic updates
- Badge assignment system (5 badges)
- Proximity search with PostGIS
- Auto-close on 3 verifications
- Vote tracking and reputation updates

#### Blockchain Integration
- Solana devnet connection
- Wallet generation for new users
- Automatic wallet funding (0.05 SOL)
- Balance checking utilities
- Auto-refill mechanism
- Transaction hash recording

#### Security Features
- JWT token authentication
- Role-based access control
- SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- File upload validation
- CORS configuration
- Transaction-based operations

### Technical Details

#### Dependencies
- express: ^5.1.0
- pg: ^8.16.3 (PostgreSQL client)
- @solana/web3.js: ^1.98.4
- jsonwebtoken: ^9.0.2

#### Architecture
- MVC pattern (Models-Views-Controllers)
- Modular route organization
- Middleware-based authentication
- Utility functions for complex logic
- Database connection pooling
- Transaction management for data consistency

#### Performance
- PostGIS spatial indexes
